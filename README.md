# Vehla Extensions

Build command packages that add new capabilities to Vehla’s Store.

An extension can contain one command, an entire toolkit, or an opt-in native
workspace. Commands can:

- Accept palette arguments, selected text, and clipboard text.
- Perform synchronous or asynchronous JavaScript or Swift work.
- Call public or private HTTP APIs.
- read and write extension-owned persistent data.
- Copy generated output to the clipboard.
- Open HTTP and HTTPS URLs.
- Display a message.
- Report useful errors without destabilizing Vehla.

This repository contains TypeScript/JavaScript and Swift SDKs with complete example extensions.

## Current platform scope

The current Store API is optimized for command-driven extensions.

Supported:

- Multiple commands per package.
- Keyword invocation and palette discovery.
- Node.js 20 or newer.
- Native Swift executable extensions built with Swift 6.
- Store API 2 native SwiftUI/AppKit workspaces hosted in Vehla.
- Store API 3 signed Swift Dock widgets with compact, inline, and popup surfaces.
- Asynchronous handlers.
- Clipboard and selected-text context.
- Network requests.
- Private persistent storage.
- Typed Swift storage and preferences APIs.
- Structured Swift logging with secret redaction.
- Permission-aware bounded Swift HTTP requests.
- Keychain-backed extension secrets.
- Declarative native command forms.
- Structured native result views and brokered action buttons.
- Native single and multiple file selection.
- Brokered macOS notifications.
- Browser handoff.
- Structured validation and errors.
- A separate process per invocation.
- Background-only command execution without extension-owned app UI.
- A 15-second execution limit.
- A 1 MB protocol output limit.

Native UI workspaces are a separate runtime. Their signed bundles load into
Vehla's process so they can provide complete SwiftUI/AppKit interfaces inside
the palette panel. They are not sandboxed, do not use the command timeout, and
can access or compromise anything available to Vehla. Vehla labels them
unsafe, warns before installation, and requires explicit risk acceptance for
each package version before first launch.

Dock widgets use the same trusted in-process model. Their signed bundles can
provide compact, inline, and popup surfaces beside the macOS Dock. They must
declare persistent storage, support the compact surface, and stop cancellable
background work when Vehla reports that the widget is hidden or closing.

Not yet supported:

- Long-running background processes.
- Scheduled commands.
- Extension-defined global hotkeys.
- A security sandbox for JavaScript.

```

## Prerequisites

- macOS with Vehla’s Store feature.
- Node.js 20 or newer.
- An Apple Silicon Mac and Swift 6 or newer for native extensions.
- Basic JavaScript, TypeScript, or Swift knowledge.

Confirm Node is available:

```sh
node --version
```

For native extensions, confirm Swift is available:

```sh
swift --version
```

## Install from Vehla

Published extensions are available directly in Vehla:

1. Open Vehla Settings.
2. Select Store.
3. Choose **Refresh Catalog**.
4. Review an extension’s commands and requested capabilities.
5. Choose **Install**.
6. Set each permission to Ask, Allow, or Deny.
7. Invoke one of the displayed keywords from the palette.

When a newer catalog version is available, the Install button becomes **Update**. Updating replaces the installed package while preserving its enabled state, permission decisions, and private data.

Every catalog archive has a SHA-256 checksum. Vehla verifies the downloaded archive against `catalog.json` before extracting or installing it. Signed entries also carry an Ed25519 publisher identity and archive signature. Vehla shows the signing-key fingerprint before first trust and blocks silent key changes.

## Try a local development extension

Install its local SDK dependency:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ibuhs/vehla-extensions.git
cd vehla-extensions
npm --prefix extensions/github-workflow install --install-links
```

Then:

1. Open Vehla Settings.
2. Select Store.
3. Choose **Install Local Package**.
4. Select `extensions/github-workflow`.
5. Review its commands and requested capabilities.
6. Enable the package.
7. Invoke `ghrepo apple/swift` from the palette.

`--install-links` is important for local SDK development. It places a self-contained SDK copy inside the extension’s `node_modules` directory. Vehla rejects symbolic links that escape an installed package.

## Try the native Swift extension

Build the included arm64 executable:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ibuhs/vehla-extensions.git
cd vehla-extensions
zsh extensions/swift-hello/build.sh
```

Then:

1. Open **Vehla Settings → Store**.
2. Choose **Install Local Package**.
3. Select `extensions/swift-hello`.
4. Confirm the package shows **Native executable**.
5. Run `swifthello` to test forms, rich results, actions, and notifications.
6. Run `swiftruntime` to inspect the isolated native process.

The build script compiles an optimized arm64 executable at `extensions/swift-hello/bin/swift-hello` and applies an ad hoc code signature.

For the complete Swift package layout, API reference, build process, diagnostics, publishing instructions, security model, and troubleshooting guide, read [`sdk/swift/README.md`](sdk/swift/README.md).

Every Store invocation runs in a separate background process. The Swift SDK also prohibits AppKit activation, so SDK-based extensions cannot become foreground applications. This guarantee is distinct from a persistent background service: each command still has a 15-second execution limit.

Use the included Swift developer CLI to validate, build, test, package, or code-sign an extension:

```sh
swift run --package-path sdk/swift vehla-swift help
swift run --package-path sdk/swift vehla-swift validate extensions/swift-hello
swift run --package-path sdk/swift vehla-swift test extensions/swift-hello runtime
```

Run the comprehensive service API example:

```sh
swift run --package-path sdk/swift \
  vehla-swift build extensions/swift-sdk-lab
swift run --package-path sdk/swift \
  vehla-swift test extensions/swift-sdk-lab run-demo
```

Swift SDK Lab demonstrates atomic private storage, typed Codable preferences, structured secret-redacting logs, invocation capability grants, and bounded HTTP networking. See [`extensions/swift-sdk-lab/README.md`](extensions/swift-sdk-lab/README.md).

## Create a JavaScript package

Create this structure:

```text
my-extension/
├── extension.json
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── index.js
└── node_modules/
```

Example `package.json` while developing inside this repository:

```json
{
  "name": "my-vehla-extension",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {
    "@vehla/store-sdk": "file:../../sdk/typescript"
  }
}
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm --prefix extensions/my-extension install --install-links
```

## Manifest reference

Every package must contain `extension.json`.

```json
{
  "apiVersion": 1,
  "id": "com.example.my-extension",
  "name": "My Extension",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A concise user-facing description.",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "entrypoint": "index.js",
  "commands": [
    {
      "id": "hello",
      "title": "Say Hello",
      "subtitle": "Create a greeting",
      "keywords": ["hello", "greet"],
      "systemImage": "hand.wave"
    }
  ],
  "capabilities": [
    "clipboardWrite"
  ],
  "secrets": [
    {
      "id": "apiToken",
      "label": "API Token",
      "description": "Token used to authenticate API requests.",
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Top-level fields

`apiVersion`

- Required integer.
- Must currently be `1`.
- Vehla rejects unsupported versions.

`id`

- Required stable package identifier.
- Use reverse-domain notation: `com.company.package`.
- Allowed characters are letters, numbers, `.`, `_`, and `-`.
- Must begin with a letter or number.
- Do not change it between releases; it identifies installed state and permissions.

`name`

- Required user-facing package name.

`version`

- Required version string.
- Semantic versioning is recommended.

`description`

- Optional package summary shown in Store settings.

`author`

- Optional author or organization.

`runtime`

- Optional runtime identifier.
- Defaults to `node` for backward compatibility.
- Use `executable` for Swift and other compiled native command extensions.
- Native executable packages must include a code-signed arm64-only Mach-O binary. Catalog delivery additionally requires a valid Ed25519 publisher signature; unsigned native catalog packages are blocked.

`entrypoint`

- Required relative path inside the package.
- For `node`, this is the JavaScript module launched with Node.js.
- For `executable`, this is the native binary launched directly.
- Executable entrypoints must have executable file permissions.
- Absolute paths and `..` path traversal are rejected.
- The resolved entrypoint must remain inside the package.

`commands`

- Required non-empty command array.
- Command IDs must be unique within the package.

`capabilities`

- Optional package capability declarations.
- Undeclared broker actions are denied.

`secrets`

- Optional declarations for credentials configured by the user in Store settings.
- Each declaration requires a unique `id` and non-empty `label`.
- `description` explains where the value comes from and how the extension uses it.
- Set `required` to `true` to prevent command execution until the value is configured.
- Declarations never contain the secret value.
- Values are stored in the macOS Keychain, scoped to the package ID, and removed when the package is uninstalled.

### Command fields

`id`

- Stable identifier unique within the package.
- Vehla namespaces it with the package ID.

`title`

- Main palette result title.

`subtitle`

- Optional one-line explanation.

`keywords`

- Optional invocation shortcuts.
- An exact keyword invokes the command with an empty query.
- Text following a keyword becomes `invocation.query`.
- Example: `ghrepo apple/swift` invokes keyword `ghrepo` with query `apple/swift`.

`systemImage`

- Optional SF Symbol name.
- Defaults to `shippingbox`.
- Use symbols available on Vehla’s macOS deployment target.

`form`

- Optional declarative form displayed before the command runs.
- Vehla owns rendering, validation, keyboard behavior, and value collection.
- Supported field types are `text`, `secureText`, `multilineText`, `toggle`, `select`, `file`, and `files`.
- Extensions cannot inject arbitrary SwiftUI, HTML, or JavaScript into the form.

## Capabilities

Capabilities communicate intent and gate Vehla-provided context or actions.

### `clipboardRead`

Allows clipboard text to be included as `invocation.context.clipboardText`.

### `clipboardWrite`

Allows a `copyText` result action.

### `selectedText`

Allows captured frontmost-application text to be included as `invocation.context.selectedText`.

### `openURL`

Allows an `openURL` result action.

Only HTTP and HTTPS URLs are accepted by the broker.

### `networkAccess`

Requires approval before a package declaring network access is launched.

This is an intent and launch gate, not host-level network isolation. JavaScript currently runs under the user’s account.

### `persistentStorage`

Provides a private directory path in `invocation.context.dataDirectory`.

Use it for extension-owned settings, caches, and records. Vehla removes this directory when the package is uninstalled.

### `notifications`

Allows `notify` result actions. Vehla requests macOS notification authorization before delivery.

### `userSelectedFiles`

Allows commands to declare native `file` and `files` form fields. Vehla asks for capability approval before presenting the picker and supplies metadata only for paths chosen in that form.

## Permission behavior

Each requested capability has three saved states:

- **Ask:** prompt when the capability is needed.
- **Allow:** approve future uses.
- **Deny:** reject the capability.

The permission prompt supports:

- Allow Once.
- Always Allow.
- Deny.

Extensions must handle missing optional context. A user may allow clipboard access but deny selected text, or vice versa.

## Write an entrypoint

```js
import { Store, runStoreExtension } from "@vehla/store-sdk";

runStoreExtension(async (invocation) => {
  switch (invocation.commandID) {
    case "hello": {
      const subject =
        invocation.query ||
        invocation.context.selectedText ||
        invocation.context.clipboardText ||
        "there";

      return Store.copyText(`Hello, ${subject}!`);
    }

    default:
      throw new Error(`Unknown command: ${invocation.commandID}`);
  }
});
```

Call `runStoreExtension` exactly once. The SDK:

1. Reads newline-delimited JSON-RPC from standard input.
2. Validates the request envelope.
3. Calls your handler.
4. Writes one JSON-RPC response to standard output.
5. Converts thrown errors into protocol errors.

## Invocation object

```ts
interface StoreInvocation {
  packageID: string;
  commandID: string;
  query: string;
  context: {
    selectedText?: string;
    clipboardText?: string;
    frontmostApplication?: string;
    dataDirectory?: string;
    secrets: Readonly<Record<string, string>>;
    formValues: Readonly<Record<
      string,
      string | boolean | StoreSelectedFile | StoreSelectedFile[]
    >>;
  };
}
```

`packageID`

- The manifest package ID.

`commandID`

- The selected command’s manifest ID.

`query`

- Text after an exact keyword.
- Empty when a user selects a command by title without arguments.

`selectedText`

- Present only when text was captured and permission was granted.

`clipboardText`

- Present only when clipboard text exists and permission was granted.

`frontmostApplication`

- Best-effort application context captured by Vehla.

`dataDirectory`

- Present when persistent storage was declared and approved.

`secrets`

- Contains only values declared by the installed manifest and configured in Store settings.
- Optional unconfigured secrets are omitted.
- A command is not launched when a required secret is missing.
- Treat values as transient credentials: do not log, copy, persist, or include them in errors.

`formValues`

- Contains values submitted through the command’s manifest form.
- Text, secure text, multiline text, and select fields are strings.
- Toggle fields are Booleans.
- Secure text values are never persisted and are redacted from runtime diagnostics.
- Single file fields contain a `StoreSelectedFile`; multiple file fields contain an array.

## Declarative command forms

Add a `form` to a command:

```json
{
  "id": "request",
  "title": "Run API Request",
  "keywords": ["request"],
  "systemImage": "paperplane",
  "form": {
    "title": "API Request",
    "description": "Configure the request before it runs.",
    "submitLabel": "Send",
    "fields": [
      {
        "id": "method",
        "type": "select",
        "label": "Method",
        "defaultValue": "GET",
        "options": [
          {"id": "GET", "label": "GET"},
          {"id": "POST", "label": "POST"}
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": "url",
        "type": "text",
        "label": "URL",
        "placeholder": "https://api.example.com/items",
        "required": true
      },
      {
        "id": "body",
        "type": "multilineText",
        "label": "JSON body"
      },
      {
        "id": "confirm",
        "type": "toggle",
        "label": "Confirm request",
        "defaultValue": false
      },
      {
        "id": "oneTimeToken",
        "type": "secureText",
        "label": "One-time token",
        "description": "Transient input for this invocation only."
      },
      {
        "id": "attachments",
        "type": "files",
        "label": "Attachments",
        "allowedFileTypes": ["json", "public.image"],
        "maximumSelection": 10
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Read submitted values:

```js
const { method, url, body, confirm, oneTimeToken, attachments } =
  invocation.context.formValues;
```

Selected file metadata:

```ts
interface StoreSelectedFile {
  path: string;
  name: string;
  isDirectory: boolean;
  size?: number;
  contentType?: string;
}
```

`allowedFileTypes` accepts filename extensions or Uniform Type Identifiers. Set `allowsDirectories` to permit folders. A `file` field returns one metadata object; a `files` field returns an array and may set `maximumSelection` from 1 through 100.

Rules:

- Form and field IDs are validated when the package is installed.
- A form supports up to 24 fields.
- Field IDs must be unique within the form.
- Required text and select fields must have a non-empty value.
- A required toggle must be enabled.
- Required file fields must contain at least one selection.
- Select defaults must match a declared option ID.
- Closing or cancelling the form does not launch the extension process.
- `secureText` is for one-time input. Use manifest secrets for credentials that must persist.
- File fields require the package to declare `userSelectedFiles`.

## Input precedence

Most text commands should use:

```js
function inputFor(invocation) {
  return (
    invocation.query ||
    invocation.context.selectedText ||
    invocation.context.clipboardText ||
    ""
  );
}
```

Use `query` first so explicit arguments win. Preserve whitespace for hashing, encoding, or formatting commands when whitespace is meaningful.

For generators such as passwords, read options only from `invocation.query`; do not accidentally interpret clipboard contents as configuration.

## Result actions

A handler returns a result object or nothing.

### Copy text

Requires `clipboardWrite`.

```js
return Store.copyText("Generated output");
```

Equivalent protocol result:

```json
{
  "action": {
    "type": "copyText",
    "value": "Generated output"
  }
}
```

### Open a URL

Requires `openURL`.

```js
return Store.openURL("https://example.com");
```

Only HTTP and HTTPS URLs are allowed.

### Show a message

```js
return Store.showMessage("Operation completed.");
```

Use messages for short confirmations. Prefer clipboard output for reports and substantial content.

### Deliver a notification

Requires `notifications`.

```js
return Store.notify("Export complete", "12 files were processed.");
```

Equivalent action:

```json
{
  "action": {
    "type": "notify",
    "title": "Export complete",
    "value": "12 files were processed."
  }
}
```

Vehla checks the package capability and requests macOS authorization. Use notifications for completion events that remain useful after the command window closes, not as a replacement for errors or rich results.

### Message plus action

The protocol supports both fields:

```js
return {
  message: "Copied formatted JSON.",
  action: {
    type: "copyText",
    value: formatted,
  },
};
```

## Rich result views

Use `Store.view` to display a structured native result:

```js
return Store.view({
  title: "Request completed",
  subtitle: "https://api.example.com/items",
  sections: [
    {
      title: "Response",
      items: [
        { type: "detail", label: "Status", value: "200 OK" },
        { type: "markdown", text: "**3 records** returned." },
        { type: "code", language: "json", text: JSON.stringify(data, null, 2) }
      ]
    }
  ],
  actions: [
    {
      type: "copyText",
      value: JSON.stringify(data, null, 2),
      label: "Copy JSON",
      systemImage: "doc.on.doc"
    }
  ]
});
```

Supported item types:

- `text` — selectable plain text.
- `markdown` — native inline Markdown.
- `code` — selectable monospaced content with horizontal scrolling.
- `detail` — a label/value row.

Result actions use the `copyText`, `openURL`, `showMessage`, and `notify` broker. Capability checks still apply when a user selects an action. A result can contain at most 20 sections, 100 total items, and 8 actions.

Vehla validates the schema and renders native controls. Extensions cannot return arbitrary views, scripts, event handlers, or remote HTML.

## Asynchronous commands

Handlers may return promises:

```js
runStoreExtension(async (invocation) => {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data", {
    signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10_000),
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`API returned ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`);
  }

  return Store.copyText(JSON.stringify(await response.json(), null, 2));
});
```

Recommended network practices:

- Declare `networkAccess`.
- Set explicit timeouts below Vehla’s 15-second command limit.
- Check `response.ok`.
- Bound downloaded body sizes.
- Truncate large reports.
- Avoid silently following unlimited redirect chains.
- Add a descriptive `User-Agent` for public APIs.
- Explain unauthenticated API rate limits.

## Persistent storage

Declare `persistentStorage`, then use the provided directory:

```js
import fs from "node:fs/promises";
import path from "node:path";

async function saveState(invocation, state) {
  const directory = invocation.context.dataDirectory;
  if (!directory) {
    throw new Error("Persistent storage permission is required.");
  }

  await fs.mkdir(directory, { recursive: true });
  const destination = path.join(directory, "state.json");
  const temporary = `${destination}.${process.pid}.tmp`;

  await fs.writeFile(temporary, JSON.stringify(state, null, 2), "utf8");
  await fs.rename(temporary, destination);
}
```

Use atomic temporary-file replacement to reduce corruption risk.

Do not store passwords, API keys, OAuth tokens, or production webhook secrets in plain JSON. Declare them in the manifest and read them from `invocation.context.secrets`.

## Secure secrets

Declare credentials in `extension.json`:

```json
{
  "secrets": [
    {
      "id": "apiToken",
      "label": "API Token",
      "description": "Create a read-only token in the service dashboard.",
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Read the value only when handling a command:

```js
const token = invocation.context.secrets.apiToken;

const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/v1/items", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
});
```

Vehla stores configured values in the macOS Keychain, never in Store state or the extension directory. Runtime diagnostics and protocol error messages are redacted before Vehla displays them when they contain an injected value.

The extension process receives declared values for the duration of each invocation. Because JavaScript packages are not sandboxed, install only trusted source. Keychain storage protects credentials at rest; it cannot make a malicious extension safe.

Guidelines:

- Request the narrowest token scopes the service supports.
- Prefer optional secrets when commands can work anonymously.
- Never put a real value in `extension.json`, source, query text, saved data, or generated cURL output.
- Never include a secret in thrown errors, logs, reports, or action values.
- Do not use secret values as URLs because they can appear in server and proxy logs.
- Replacing a secret updates the Keychain item without exposing the old value to the settings UI.


## Design multiple commands

Prefer one package for commands that share:

- A domain or service.
- Parsing utilities.
- Persistent data.
- Permissions.
- A consistent mental model.

Dispatch by `commandID`:

```js
const handlers = {
  inspect: inspectCommand,
  list: listCommand,
  delete: deleteCommand,
};

runStoreExtension(async (invocation) => {
  const handler = handlers[invocation.commandID];
  if (!handler) throw new Error(`Unknown command: ${invocation.commandID}`);
  return handler(invocation);
});
```

Split unrelated capabilities into separate packages. Permissions are package-wide in API version 1, so a focused package avoids requesting capabilities that some commands never need.

## Argument syntax

Palette commands receive one query string. Define a predictable mini-syntax for structured input.

The examples use `|` separators:

```text
owner/repository | Issue title | Issue body
POST https://example.com/hook | {"hello":"world"} | Authorization: Bearer token
```

Parser:

```js
function parts(value) {
  return value.split("|").map((part) => part.trim());
}
```

For richer input:

- Accept JSON as the query.
- Support `name=value` pairs.
- Read a saved configuration from persistent storage.
- Open a web URL for complex creation forms.

Document escaping limitations. If `|` is valid inside payloads, use JSON input instead of a delimiter.

## Validation and errors

Throw concise, actionable errors:

```js
if (!repository.includes("/")) {
  throw new Error("Use owner/repository, for example apple/swift.");
}
```

Good errors include:

- What is wrong.
- The accepted format.
- A safe example.

Avoid:

- Stack traces as user messages.
- Leaking request authorization headers.
- Returning entire HTML error pages.
- Catching every error and pretending the command succeeded.

The SDK serializes thrown errors. Write developer diagnostics to standard error:

```js
console.error("Detailed diagnostic for extension developers");
```

Never write logs to standard output. Standard output is reserved for the JSON-RPC response.

## Raw protocol

The SDK is optional. Any executable JavaScript entrypoint that implements this protocol can work.

Vehla launches:

```text
node /absolute/package/path/index.js
```

It sends one newline-terminated request:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "request-uuid",
  "method": "store.invoke",
  "params": {
    "packageID": "com.example.my-extension",
    "commandID": "hello",
    "query": "world",
    "context": {
      "selectedText": "optional",
      "clipboardText": "optional",
      "frontmostApplication": "optional",
      "dataDirectory": "optional",
      "secrets": {
        "apiToken": "test-only-placeholder"
      },
      "formValues": {
        "url": "https://example.com",
        "confirm": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Success response:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "request-uuid",
  "result": {
    "action": {
      "type": "copyText",
      "value": "Hello, world!"
    }
  }
}
```

Error response:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "request-uuid",
  "error": {
    "code": -32000,
    "message": "A useful error message."
  }
}
```

Requirements:

- `jsonrpc` must be `2.0`.
- Response `id` must match the request.
- Emit one response line.
- Keep standard output under 1 MB.
- Finish within 15 seconds.

## Execution environment

Each invocation receives a new child process.

The environment is intentionally reduced. It includes:

- `PATH`
- `HOME`
- `TMPDIR`
- `NO_COLOR=1`
- `TERM=dumb`
- `VEHLA_STORE_API_VERSION=1`

Common Node locations are included:

- `/opt/homebrew/bin`
- `/usr/local/bin`
- `/usr/bin`
- `/bin`

Do not depend on arbitrary parent-process environment variables.

The package directory is the process working directory, but resolve files from `import.meta.url` when practical.

## Security model

Install only trusted packages.

Current protections:

- Manifest validation.
- Relative entrypoint enforcement.
- Path containment checks.
- Rejection of symbolic links escaping the package.
- Reduced environment.
- Separate process crash isolation.
- Timeout and output limits.
- Declared broker capabilities.
- Ask, Allow, and Deny decisions.
- Keychain-backed storage for declared secrets.
- Required-secret launch checks and runtime diagnostic redaction.
- Validation and native rendering of declarative forms and rich results.
- Explicit user selection before file metadata is shared.
- Capability and macOS authorization checks for notifications.
- HTTP/HTTPS restriction for brokered URL opening.
- Optional Ed25519 archive signatures.
- Explicit first-use trust for new publisher keys.
- Persisted publisher-key continuity for updates.
- Blocking of unsigned catalog updates over verified packages.
- Blocking of every unsigned native executable delivered through the catalog.

Current limitation:

JavaScript and native executables are not executed in a security sandbox. Processes run under the user’s macOS account and may access resources independently of Vehla’s broker. Capability declarations do not contain arbitrary Node.js or native system APIs.

Therefore:

- Review source before installation.
- Do not install unknown packages.
- Do not embed secrets in manifests.
- Do not commit credentials.
- Do not mistake Keychain storage for extension sandboxing.
- Do not assume `networkAccess` is a network firewall.
- Do not spawn arbitrary shell commands in community packages.

## Local testing

Test a command without opening Vehla:

```sh
printf '%s\n' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"test","method":"store.invoke","params":{"packageID":"com.example.my-extension","commandID":"hello","query":"world","context":{}}}' \
  | node extensions/my-extension/index.js
```

Expected response:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"test","result":{"action":{"type":"copyText","value":"Hello, world!"}}}
```

Test all meaningful branches:

- Valid explicit query.
- Selected-text fallback.
- Clipboard fallback.
- Empty input.
- Invalid input.
- Network timeout.
- Non-2xx response.
- Missing storage permission.
- Empty persistent state.
- Corrupt persistent state.
- Oversized remote response.

## Installation and updates

During local development:

1. Run `npm install --install-links`.
2. Install the package directory in Settings → Store.
3. Test its keywords.
4. Edit the source package.
5. Reinstall it to copy the new version into Vehla.

Vehla executes the installed copy, not the original development directory.

Keep package IDs stable between versions so enablement and permission state remain associated with the package.

## Troubleshooting

### Package does not install

Check:

- `extension.json` exists at the selected directory root.
- `apiVersion` is `1`.
- Package and command IDs contain only supported characters.
- The entrypoint exists.
- The entrypoint is relative.
- No symbolic link resolves outside the package.
- Commands are non-empty and IDs are unique.

### Command does not appear

Check:

- The package is enabled.
- The package has no entrypoint diagnostic.
- The command has a title.
- Search by title or an exact keyword.

### `node` cannot be launched

Install Node.js 20 or newer. Apple Silicon Homebrew commonly installs it at `/opt/homebrew/bin/node`.

### Module cannot be found

Run:

```sh
npm install --install-links
```

Confirm `node_modules/@vehla/store-sdk/index.js` exists inside the package before installation.

### Permission required

Open Settings → Store and change the requested capability to Ask or Allow. A Deny decision suppresses approval prompts.

### Command returns no useful input

Use an exact keyword with arguments, or grant selected-text/clipboard permission. Selecting by title intentionally provides an empty query.

### Network request times out

Use an `AbortSignal` timeout below 15 seconds and provide a compact error. Vehla terminates commands that exceed its invocation limit.

### Vehla reports an invalid response

Ensure:

- Standard output contains only one JSON response line.
- Logs go to standard error.
- The response ID matches the request.
- The process exits successfully.

## Publishing checklist

Before sharing a package:

- Use a stable reverse-domain package ID.
- Use a unique ID for every command.
- Request only necessary capabilities.
- Include a clear description and command subtitles.
- Document keyword syntax.
- Include a lockfile.
- Include all runtime dependencies.
- Remove development secrets.
- Test from a fresh clone.
- Test the installed copy.
- Test denied permissions.
- Test malformed input.
- Add timeouts and response limits.
- State whether remote data leaves the Mac.
- State where persistent data is stored.
- Include a license.

## Publish to the catalog

Catalog entries contain:

- The complete validated extension manifest.
- An HTTPS URL for a self-contained ZIP archive.
- The archive’s SHA-256 checksum.
- The relative package root inside the archive.
- For signed packages, the publisher ID, display name, key ID, Ed25519 public key, and archive signature.

Build all archives and regenerate `catalog.json`:

```sh
python3 scripts/build-catalog.py
```

Build or update one package while preserving every other catalog entry:

```sh
python3 scripts/build-catalog.py --only toolbox-native
```

The build script:

1. Finds every directory under `extensions/` containing `extension.json`.
2. Runs `npm install --install-links` for Node packages or `build.sh` for
   executable, Native UI, and Dock Widget packages.
3. Reuses an immutable matching archive or creates `packages/<directory>-<version>.zip`.
4. Calculates each archive’s SHA-256 checksum.
5. Optionally signs the exact archive bytes with an Ed25519 publisher key.
6. Rebuilds `catalog.json` from the extension manifests.

Package-specific `README.md` files and generated SwiftPM, Xcode, and `dist`
directories are excluded from runtime archives. The signed `bin` entrypoint is
included. If an existing versioned archive differs from the remaining package
contents, the build fails and requires a manifest version increment.

### Sign catalog packages

Generate an Ed25519 publisher keypair once:

```sh
swift scripts/publisher-signing.swift generate
```

The command prints base64-encoded `privateKey` and `publicKey` values. Store the private key in a password manager or CI secret immediately. Never commit it, place it in an extension directory, or include it in an archive. The public key can be shared and independently compared with the fingerprint Vehla displays.

Configure a signed catalog build:

```sh
export VEHLA_PUBLISHER_ID="com.example.publisher"
export VEHLA_PUBLISHER_NAME="Example Publisher"
export VEHLA_PUBLISHER_KEY_ID="release-2026"
export VEHLA_PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY="<base64 privateKey>"
python3 scripts/build-catalog.py
unset VEHLA_PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY
```

All four variables are required for a signed build. A Node.js-only catalog may omit them, but any catalog containing a native package fails unless signing is configured. Vehla also rejects unsigned native catalog packages at validation and installation time. A partial signing configuration fails closed.

The signing script derives the public key from the private key, signs each final ZIP byte-for-byte, and writes the base64 signature and publisher identity into that package’s catalog entry. Vehla verifies both the existing SHA-256 checksum and the Ed25519 signature before extraction.

On first install, Vehla displays:

- Publisher name and stable ID.
- Key ID.
- SHA-256 fingerprint of the raw public key.
- An explicit **Trust and Install** decision.

Future updates using the same publisher ID and public key are marked verified. A changed publisher ID or public key triggers a critical warning and requires explicit trust. Verify a rotated key fingerprint through a separate trusted channel before accepting it.

Users can revoke a remembered key from the installed package’s menu with **Forget Publisher Trust**. The installed bytes remain unchanged, but later catalog installs from that publisher require first-use trust again.

For CI, store `VEHLA_PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY` as an encrypted repository or organization secret. Keep the non-secret publisher ID, name, and key ID in protected workflow configuration. Restrict release workflow approval and secret access to trusted maintainers.

### Publish an externally signed package

Third-party publishers keep their private keys and sign their own immutable
archive. Place both files under the extension source directory:

```text
releases/<directory>-<version>.zip
releases/<directory>-<version>.signature.json
```

The signature JSON must contain `sha256`, `signature`, and a `publisher` object
with `id`, `name`, `keyID`, and `publicKey`. It may also contain
`publicKeyFingerprintSHA256`. The archive must use the extension directory name
as its root and contain an `extension.json` identical to the source manifest.

The catalog builder verifies the checksum, fingerprint, Ed25519 signature, and
archived manifest. It then copies the archive byte-for-byte into `packages/`
and preserves the external publisher identity in `catalog.json`. It never
needs or accepts the publisher’s private key.

Before publishing:

```sh
git diff --check
git status
```

Test an archive independently:

```sh
temporary_directory="$(mktemp -d)"
ditto -x -k packages/my-extension-1.0.0.zip "$temporary_directory"
printf '%s\n' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"test","method":"store.invoke","params":{"packageID":"com.example.my-extension","commandID":"hello","query":"world","context":{}}}' \
  | node "$temporary_directory/my-extension/index.js"
rm -rf "$temporary_directory"
```

Publishing rules:

- Increment the manifest version whenever archive contents change.
- Never replace a published version with different bytes.
- Sign the final immutable archive, not its source directory.
- Keep publisher IDs stable across releases.
- Treat key rotation as a security event and announce the new fingerprint separately.
- Never reuse a compromised signing key.
- Commit the extension source, archive, and catalog update together.
- Keep archive URLs immutable and HTTPS-only.
- Do not add a catalog entry for an extension that has not been source-reviewed.
- Verify installation and invocation from Vehla after publication.

## Contributing

Contributions should add a focused package under `extensions/`.

Each package should include:

- `extension.json`
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- Entrypoint source
- A concise package-specific README when syntax is non-trivial

Keep examples readable. Prefer standard Node.js APIs over large dependencies. Explain security tradeoffs in comments or documentation.
