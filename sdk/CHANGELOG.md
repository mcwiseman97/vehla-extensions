# SDK Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added the documented Dock Widget app-bridge permissions to `StoreCapability`
  so manifests using shared context and app actions decode in the Swift CLI.
- Published `VehlaNativeUISDK` for Store API 2 hosted SwiftUI/AppKit workspaces.
- Published `VehlaDockWidgetSDK` for Store API 3 compact, inline, and popup
  Dock widget surfaces.
- Added Native UI and Dock Widget tests.
- Extended `vehla-swift` validation, signing, and packaging support to
  `executable`, `nativeUI`, and `dockWidget` runtimes.
- Documented local AI, theme updates, secrets, clipboard integration, lifecycle,
  in-process security, and dynamic framework host coupling.

### Changed

- TypeScript SDK package metadata now uses the repository's MIT license.
- SDK build artifacts and SwiftPM/Xcode state are ignored.
- CLI validation describes native runtimes as having full app access instead
  of labeling publisher-signed packages unsafe.
